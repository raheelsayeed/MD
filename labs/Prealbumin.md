Description
--------------
Prealbumin is a glycoprotein synthesized in liver and acts as binding protein for thyroxin and retinol-binding protein, hence it is also known as Thyroxin-binding prealbumin or transthyretin. 

USE:
Detection of Prealbumin concentration in serum is a cost effective and reliable indicator for the assessment of nutritional status and for monitoring response to nutritional therapy in an acutely ill patient. It is an early indicator of visceral protein anabolism in patients receiving nutritional support.

It reflects the synthesis capacity of liver, which if markedly diminished,  results in lower than normal serum concentration.

A Lower prealbumin concentration help identify At-risk individuals who may develop protein-energy malnutrition and thus require careful monitoring and/or nutritional support.

Values of 0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 mg/dL indicate severe, moderate,
and mild protein depletion.
